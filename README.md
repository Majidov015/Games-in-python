# Games-in-python
 Rand_game.py is my second pet project in python. It is very simple random number guessing game. Yet in this project I have learned fucntional proggramming using while infinite loop with the combination of functions. I have converted this game into exe format so it could be played in console. Go to dist\rand_game.exe to play!
